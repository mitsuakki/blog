## Building from source

### Prerequisites

* [V](https://vlang.io/)
* [leveldb](https://github.com/vlang/leveldb)
* [nbt](https://github.com/bedrock-v/nbt)
* [raknet](https://github.com/bedrock-v/raknet)
* [protocol](https://github.com/bedrock-v/protocol)
* [i18n](https://github.com/nepinhum/i18n)

Some modules aren't available through VPM yet. Until they're published, clone them manually into your V modules directory.

The V modules directory is usually:

* Linux/macOS: `~/.vmodules`
* Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.vmodules`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vlang/leveldb VMODULES_PATH/leveldb
git clone https://github.com/bedrock-v/nbt VMODULES_PATH/nbt
git clone https://github.com/bedrock-v/protocol VMODULES_PATH/protocol
git clone https://github.com/bedrock-v/raknet VMODULES_PATH/raknet

v install nepinhum.i18n
```

### Clone Vedrock

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bedrock-v/Vedrock.git
```

### Run or build

```bash
cd Vedrock

# Run without keeping a binary
v run .

# Build
v .
```

## Running with Docker

The Dockerfile builds everything from source - the pinned V compiler, all module dependencies and the server itself. No local V setup is required.

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t vedrock .

# Run the server
docker run -d --name vedrock -p 19132:19132/udp vedrock
```

Or with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The compose setup mounts `worlds/`, `players/` and `vedrock.yml` from the repository root so world data and configuration persist across container restarts.
